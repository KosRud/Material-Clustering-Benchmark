# Material Clustering Benchmark

The folder `Unity` contains a Unity project, which runs clustering repeatedly on a set of video files and generates reports in JSON format. The reports contain the clustering algorithm parameters and per-frame variance (in quality benchmark mode) or frame times (in speed benchmark mode). The reports are placed in "Reports" folder alongside the executable.

The folder `node-notebook` contains a [Node.js REPL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.typescript-notebook) notebook, which produces plots from the JSON reports.
